    <section id="about">
        <div class="container intro">
            <p>I'm a current student at Santa Monica College pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Interaction Design. Within the past year, I've completed 3 design internships at various tech startups which has helped me learn and grow tremendously as a designer in just a short amount of time. Previously, I completed 2 years at Purdue University toward a B.S. in Computer Science which was invaluable in establishing a strong technical foundation. I learned some coding basics which ultimately led to my interest in front-end development and eventually design. As a designer, I take great pride in being able to turn my designs into responsive, functional protytpes using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I built this site from scratch using the Bootstrap framework to practice learning front-end web development. I'm constantly learning and finding ways to improve my design skills. Traveling the country to attend hackathons where I get the opportunity to collaborate and build with others who are just as passionate about tech as I am is one of my favorite hobbies!</p>
            <i>Please note: I'm actively developing changes to this site and making updates to my porfolio. I apologize for the mess and any inconvenience it may cause. Updates will be completed soon! Thanks for stopping by :)</i>

FitPik is an app which allows users to quickly add clothes to the app by taking photos of the clothes in their closet and then using the app to mix and match outfits. The app also includes a lookbook which shows popular outfits posted, a feature to send outfits to your friends so that they can vote or comment on them, and suggested outfits based on the clothes in your closet.</p>

                                            <p>Before starting on this app idea, I did some competitor analysis to find any apps that have similar features as mine. Fortunately, I didn't find any. I proceeded to engage in a few user interviews to get a better idea of the audience I was designing for. I then pulled out some post-its and a marker to begin brainstorming features that I might include on the first iteration of design for the FitPik app. </p><br>

                               <p>Since most of my projects are aimed toward solving more serious issues, this was a fun project to complete for my first iOS app. It was insightful to focus on a small problem that most people face but is often overlooked. There were several additional features that I would love to add that were outside the scope of this project due to the short timeframe as previously mentioned.</p>

                                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>The public transportation system in Detroit, MI is extremely unsafe and inefficient for many of the residents there that rely on it. A team of myself and 3 others had 36 hours to come up with a solution at MHacks, The University of Michigan's premiere hackathon. Our solution is a simple web app which shows high crime ridden areas on a heat map and routes the user around those areas. Whether walking, biking, or taking a bus, we wanted to make sure people were able to travel safer by being more aware of their surroundings. Rather than finding only the quickest route like Google Maps uses, we wanted to find the safest route.</p>

                                    - There were large areas on the heat map which did not show a lot of crime. These areas were near highways.<br>
                                    - Not all buses have security cameras on them.<br>
                                    - Bus schedules aren't reliable and commuters are sometimes late.<br>

I knew that I wanted to have something with a really large map and the navigation input fields either beside or above the map. Ultimately, I ended up deciding on a design with the route information on the left hand side and the map on the right hand side similar to Google Maps because it offers a familiar interface to the user and is very simple to use.</p>

                                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Since this was done at a hackathon with time constraints and a lack of resources, I was unable to conduct all of the research and planning that I would have liked. Additionally, there were some issues with the development of the project so unfortunately, there isn't a fully functional web app that you can check out. I coded a mobile responsive protype which you can see here.</p>
                               <p>This was a really fun project to work on so I'm happy that I had the opportunity to design it. I see the future of TranSafe expanding beyond just showing the safest route and beyond the Detroit area. Weather conditions, showing buses that have cameras, a real-time feed with traffic updates, and other features are all additional ideas that we had for this app that we were unable to implement due to the time constraint.</p>

                                            <p>Starting off with basic sketches of the design was a necessary step in this process. From there, I was able to get a better idea of how I wanted the layout and general "feel" of the web app to be. I experimented with various uses of our organization's colors while keeping a very clean and minimal look. I chose to use an image of mountains in the header to depict a sense of adventure and new territory. This is a brand new organization on campus focused on innovation so we wanted a simple photo to portray that.</p>

                                <p>I developed this design using Bootstrap for a simple, mobile responsive design. We are doing some testing and analysis to figure out what is working well, we can improve on, and what we should add or change entirely. Since we skipped the resaerch and analysis phase in the beginning, we are now taking the time to go back and analyze our findings.</p>

                                <p><strong>Challenges: </strong>The biggest challenge about this project was the fact that it was a solo project. Although I was able to start building up a team that I could receive feedback from and in which we could brainstorm together and bounce ideas back and forth, the initial design was developed on my own which made it harder to make significant improvements. </p>
                               <p>As we work toward restructuring our leadership team, we had to put a hold on wesite updates. We will continue testing and analyzing changes. Stay tuned for updates! </p>

                                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>I assisted with designing the flow of Impact Health's referral program. I worked closely with our Growth Hacker and developers to figure out what we needed so that I could come up with a simple design. The general idea was that people would complete a survey and then share their unique referral code for a chance to win money. For every 3 people that signed up with us and qualified for health insurance, both the referrer and referee would receive $25.</p>

To handle the amount of traffic that was coming through, I created a script in Google Sheets which automatically calculated ansd showed who needed to be paid. That is, every referee and the referrer for every 3 people that they referred. The script highlighted payment recipients and color coded them based on referrers and referees.</p>

                                <p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Working quickly and diligently to quickly come up with a design that was consistent with the rest of our product was the hardest challenge. I would've liked to spend more time on the design of the the referral program but with the fast-approaching deadline, I had to come up with something rather quickly.</p>
                               <p>As my first industry project to be launched for users, this was a very exciting project to work on. Designing the flow in addition to creating the script to help manage the referral program made this a very important learning experience. As the only designer on the team, I worked very closely with the developers to implement the design. I now feel more comfortable with working at a startup under high pressure to deliver a product by a quick deadline.</p>
