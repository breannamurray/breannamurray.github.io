    <section id="about">
        <div class="container">
            <p>I'm a current UX Design Intern at Verbistro where I also perform growth hacking activities. I'm in the process of relocating to the Los Angeles area where I'm seeking new employment opportunities. I have enrolled at Santa Monica College for the upcoming Winter 2017 semester where I plan to complete my Bachelor's of Science in Interaction Design in Fall 2018.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Previously, I completed 2 years at Purdue University toward a B.S. in Computer Science which was invaluable in establishing a strong technical foundation. I'm constantly learning and finding ways to improve my design skills. As a designer, I take great pride in being able to turn my designs into responsive, protytpes using Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Traveling the country to attend hackathons where I get the opportunity to collaborate and build with others who are just as passionate about tech as I am is one of my favorite things to do.</p>

After additional research and analysis of my wireframes, I decided that we should offer 3 different pricing tiers which easily show and compare the different plans.</p>

                                <p>I product managed an overseas developer team to quickly and accurately implement these updates. I'm currently testing out these changes and working on a third iteration of a redesign. So far I have found that the web app isn't as clear as it could be that it is a marketplace. The buy and sell CTA buttons lead to the most frequent visits to the product and pricing pages but I've found that there's not as much clicking on these as I'd thought. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to check out the web app below!</p>

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Getting people more engaged with the product is the biggest challenge for this project. I have found that I'm able to easily increase traffic to the site but once there, they still aren't engaging with the product like I'd like. I'm currently testing different methods to increase engagement.</p>
                               <p>Overall, this was a very interesting project and I got the opportunity to work with an audience I haven't yet - educators. After additional feedback, research, and brainstorming, I would still like to make additional changes to the web app. We will soon be undergoing our third iteration of the design so I'm looking forward to implementing changes and continuing to improve the design. </p>

                                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>The public transportation system in Detroit, MI is extremely unsafe and inefficient for many of the residents there that rely on it. A team of myself and 3 others had 36 hours to come up with a solution at MHacks, The University of Michigan's premiere hackathon. Our solution is a simple web app which shows high crime ridden areas on a heat map and routes the user around those areas. Whether walking, biking, or taking a bus, we wanted to make sure people were able to travel safer by being more aware of their surroundings. Rather than finding only the quickest route like Google Maps uses, we wanted to find the safest route.</p>

                                    - There were large areas on the heat map which did not show a lot of crime. These areas were near highways.<br>
                                    - Not all buses have security cameras on them.<br>
                                    - Bus schedules aren't reliable and commuters are sometimes late.<br>

I knew that I wanted to have something with a really large map and the navigation input fields either beside or above the map. Ultimately, I ended up deciding on a design with the route information on the left hand side and the map on the right hand side similar to Google Maps because it offers a familiar interface to the user and is very simple to use.</p>

                                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Since this was done at a hackathon with time constraints and a lack of resources, I was unable to conduct all of the research and planning that I would have liked. Additionally, there were some issues with the development of the project so unfortunately, there isn't a fully functional web app that you can check out. I coded a mobile responsive protype which you can see here.</p>
                               <p>This was a really fun project to work on so I'm happy that I had the opportunity to design it. I see the future of TranSafe expanding beyond just showing the safest route and beyond the Detroit area. Weather conditions, showing buses that have cameras, a real-time feed with traffic updates, and other features are all additional ideas that we had for this app that we were unable to implement due to the time constraint.</p>

I experimented with various uses of our organization's colors while keeping a very clean and minimal look. I chose to use an image of mountains in the header to depict a sense of adventure and new territory. This is a brand new organization on campus focused on innovation so we wanted a simple photo to portray that.</p>

                                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>I assisted with designing the flow of Impact Health's referral program. I worked closely with our Growth Hacker and developers to figure out what we needed so that I could come up with a simple design. The general idea was that people would complete a survey and then share their unique referral code for a chance to win money. For every 3 people that signed up with us and qualified for health insurance, both the referrer and referee would receive $25.</p>

                                            <p>After working with the developer team to ensure that my designs were implemented exactly as I had visualized, we finally launched the referral program. To handle the amount of traffic that was coming through, I created a script in Google Sheets which automatically calculated ansd showed who needed to be paid. That is, every referee and the referrer for every 3 people that they referred. The script highlighted payment recipients and color coded them based on referrers and referees.</p>

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Working quickly and diligently to quickly come up with a design that was consistent with the rest of our product was the hardest challenge. I would've liked to spend more time on the design of the the referral program but with the fast-approaching deadline, I had to come up with something rather quickly.</p>
                               <p>As my first industry project to be launched for users, this was a very exciting project to work on. Designing the flow in addition to creating the script to help manage the referral program made this a very important learning experience. I now feel more comfortable with working at a startup under high pressure to deliver a product by a quick deadline.</p>
