            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>One of the most dreaded, time-consuming parts of our days are picking out an outfit to wear for the day. FitPik is an app which allows users to quickly add clothes to the app by taking photos of the clothes in their closet and then using the app to mix and match outfits. The app also includes a lookbook which shows popular outfits posted, a feature to send outfits to your friends so that they can vote or comment on them, and suggested outfits based on the clothes in your closet.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Research & Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <p>Before starting on this app idea, I did some competitor analysis to find any apps that have similar features as mine. Fortunately, I didn't find any. I proceeded to engage in a few user interviews to get a better idea of the audience I was designing for. I then pulled out some post-its and a marker to begin brainstorming features that I might include on the first iteration of design for the FitPik app.</p>

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Before beginning any designing, it's essential to know who you're designing for. As I mentioned previously, I interview a few users to get a better idea of my audience and then proceeded to create a few personas that portray the audience. The average age of the user would be young with an age range of 13 to 30 years old with a low disposable income.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>User Flows</h4>
            <p>With better knowledge of the user audience, I now had a better idea of what exactly I was giong to be designing. I had previously compiled a list of features that I was interested in including and I was now able to eliminate some of these features based on the audience. I mapped out the flow of the app before I started sketching ideas.</p>
